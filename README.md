# pacman
This is a search program by using different search algorithms to solve maze problems.
Basic search algorthms are breath first search, depth first search and greedy-best search and 
A\*search(using manhaton distance as heuristic default). 
A\*search and breath first search will always find the optimal solution. 
As for multiple dots in a maze, the heuristic funtion for A\*search is minimum spaning tree.
